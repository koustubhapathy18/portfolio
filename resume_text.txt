◦ IoT and Mechatronics Intern, NIST University, Berhampur, Odisha: Gained hands-on experience
working with Arduino UNO and Arduino IDE, building and testing electronic prototypes. Learned 3D-printing
design, stencil preparation, and model development for hardware enclosures. Developed an ECG-Integrated Smart
Health Console using Arduino UNO R4, ECG sensor, and OLED display. The system captures real-time heart
signals, processes ECG data, and displays heart rate and waveform on the OLED screen. Built for continuous
health monitoring, the project showcases skills in embedded systems, hardware integration, signal processing, and
IoT-based health solutions.
◦ Linux: Completed hands-on learning in Linux, gaining practical experience with command-line operations, file
system navigation, user management, and permissions. Explored essential Linux commands, shell scripting basics,
package installation, and system administration tasks. Built a strong foundation in open-source environments,
improving skills in troubleshooting, automation, and server management..
◦ Wireshark: Gained hands-on experience using Wireshark for network packet analysis, traffic monitoring, and
protocol inspection. Learned how to capture live network data, filter packets, analyze protocols like
TCP/UDP/HTTP, and identify network issues. Developed strong skills in troubleshooting connectivity problems,
detecting anomalies, and understanding real-time data flow across networks.

Projects
• Campus Navigation System using python: Developed a Campus Navigation System using Python to guide
students and visitors across campus efficiently. Implemented graph-based path-finding algorithms to determine the
shortest and most accurate routes between locations. Integrated building search, map visualization, and facility
information for a smoother user experience. Designed a simple and interactive interface to make navigation easy for new
students and guests. This project improves campus accessibility and demonstrates practical use of Python for real-world
problem-solving.
• Smart Attendance Management System: Developed a Smart Attendance Management System in Java to automate
daily attendance tracking. Implemented features for adding records, marking attendance, generating reports, and
calculating percentages. Used OOP principles, Java Collections, and exception handling for clean and modular design.
Integrated file handling/MySQL for storing and retrieving attendance data efficiently. This project strengthened my
skills in Java programming, problem-solving, and real-world system development.

Certification
• Networking Basics Issued by Cisco: Completed the Cisco “Networking Basics” certification, covering core concepts
like network devices, IP addressing, and connectivity. Built a strong foundation in how networks operate, troubleshoot,
and securely transfer data.
• Introduction to Cybersecurity Issued by Cisco: Completed the Cisco “Introduction to Cybersecurity”
certification, gaining awareness of cyber threats, attacks, and modern security practices. Developed foundational skills in
protecting networks, data, and systems using essential cybersecurity principles and defense strategies.
